# Credit Risk Modeling in Python

## Overview
This project focuses on **Credit Risk Modeling**, a crucial aspect of financial risk management. The goal is to develop a machine learning model to predict the probability of default (PD) for loan applicants based on historical data.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model building using logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods
- Model evaluation with ROC-AUC, precision-recall, and confusion matrix
- Implementation of Probability of Default (PD) calculations
- Risk classification and segmentation

## Prerequisites
To run this project, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
